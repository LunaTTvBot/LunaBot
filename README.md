### 1. Overview

**iBot** is an Application that gives Twitch Streamers and Moderators all the tools to create an enjoyable experience for everybody.  
We include a chat-bot to give you the option to automate certain aspects of your Chat.  
This way, you can have things like automatic Music Requests / Polls / Ranks / Giveaways / etc.  
Additionally, you can lock these features behind Ranks, so that only real viewers may use them - make it really hard for trolls to grief.

### 2. Features

If you have any Ideas for new Features, create a new Issue with a description of how you think it should work and we'll let you know if we can add it.

Currently, the following features are implemented:
  - List of Users who joined your stream in the past
  - Interactive Polls

### 3. Setup

Currently **iBot** is not ready for the general public, and as such has no easy way to run it outside of our development environments. *But Stay Tuned*
