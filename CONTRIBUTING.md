# Contribution Guidelines

###### Branching, Pull Requests

When working on a new Feature, Bugfixes, or some kind of Enhancement, please follow these rules:
 - fork the project
 - branch from the latest commit on `develop`
 - name the branch according to its purpose
 - please use one of following prefixes to make categorization easier
  - `Fix`
  - `Enhancement`
  - `Feature`
  - feel free to suggest new ones
 - rebase your changes on develop to keep up-to-date
  - unless you already made a Pull Request, then merge new changes into your branch
 - try to keep the branch as simple as possible to reach the desired outcome
 - similarly, keep commit small and simple
 - when you're satisfied with your changes, open a [Merge Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
 - Write up a description of what you did, possibly also why
 - offer a guide how to test or review the changes you made

###### Coding Style

We chose to follow Microsofts official C# coding guidlines, which can be found [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff926074.aspx)  
*More specifics to come*

###### Misc.
 - don't clutter commits with style-changes on code that doesn't belong to that commit, do that in dedicated commit or enhancements
